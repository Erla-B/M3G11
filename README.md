For this project I made a 'Sign Up' form for an imagined website (Delta). 
The form requires you to input a username, email, password and date of birth and will show an error message when one or more of them are not filled out. If you fill everything out correctly you will get a success screen in the form of a popup!
This was challenging for me because of the Javascript part and took me far too much time but I'm at least happy with the results.
I put comments in the code to hopefully clarify a bit what is going on there.
